# Data--Driven-Survival-Modeling-for-Breast-Cancer
## Abstract
This study investigates data-driven survival modeling techniques for breast cancer prognostic assessments. Using a dataset of 4,024 women from the SEER program (2006â€“2010), models such as Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH), Random Survival Forests (RSF), DeepSurv, SVM with an RBF kernel, and LightGBM were applied to predict survival outcomes. To enhance interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) was used, identifying consistent and model-specific predictors of survival. This comparison highlights the strengths of machine learning and traditional approaches in breast cancer survival prediction.

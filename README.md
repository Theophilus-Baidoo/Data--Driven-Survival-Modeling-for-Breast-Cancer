# Data--Driven-Survival-Modeling-for-Breast-Cancer
## Abstract
This study explores the application of data-driven survival modeling techniques for prognostic assessments of breast cancer survival. The primary aim is to evaluate and compare machine learning (ML) models and traditional survival analysis methods in identifying key predictors of survival outcomes. Using a dataset of 4,024 women diagnosed with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer from the SEER program (2006â€“2010), models including Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH), Random Survival Forests (RSF), DeepSurv, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with an RBF kernel, and LightGBM were employed. To ensure interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) was applied across RSF, DeepSurv, Random Forests, and XGBoost, enabling the identification of consistent and unique predictors influencing survival outcomes. This analysis highlights the complementary strengths of ML and survival-specific methods in advancing personalized and data-driven approaches to healthcare.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used in my research is sourced from the **[SEER Breast Cancer Data](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/seer-breast-cancer-data)** provided by the IEEE DataPort. It includes data on breast cancer cases, allowing for extensive analysis of survival outcomes and predictors.

# Data--Driven-Survival-Modeling-for-Breast-Cancer
## Abstract
This study explores the possible use of data-driven survival modeling techniques for predicting breast cancer survival outcomes. The primary objective is to compare and assess the predictive performance of these data-driven methods against both machine learning (ML) approaches and traditional survival analysis methods.

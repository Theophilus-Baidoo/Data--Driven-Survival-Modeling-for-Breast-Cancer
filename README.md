# Data--Driven-Survival-Modeling-for-Breast-Cancer
## Abstract
This study explores the potential use of data-driven survival modeling techniques for predicting breast cancer survival outcomes using a dataset from the SEER database. The primary objective is to compare and evaluate the predictive performance of these data-driven methods against both machine learning (ML) approaches and traditional survival analysis techniques, while incorporating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the contribution of individual features to the model predictions.
